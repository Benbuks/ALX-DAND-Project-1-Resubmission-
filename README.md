# Investigate_TMDb_Movies
In this project, we shall be doing a correlational data analysis of the Movies dataset ,TMDb which was gotten from data-set-options data-set-options. , The first among the options. Download here

Our varables of interest are Viewer's Rating , Movie's Polularity ,Budget and Revenue . we shall be studying the given Dataset to try answer some questions and popluar assumptions as regards some key factors affecting the revenue generation for movies produced over the years. Our case study shall be the movies database(TMDb) , record captured from 1960 to 2015 .After investigating this dataset, we hope to answer the following research questions


## Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

## What do you need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

## Why this Project?
In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

You'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## What will you learn?
After completing the project, you will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Tip: Now that you've trimmed and cleaned your data, you're ready to move on to exploration. Compute statistics and create visualizations with the goal of addressing the research questions that you posed in the Introduction section. It is recommended that you be systematic with your approach. Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables.

## Research Questions


   **Question 1:** What is the relationship between ratings and revenues?
   
   **Question 2:** Hows does budget affects revenue?
  
   **Question 3:** Relationship between polularity of a movie and revenue
  

## Conclusions

Veiwer's rating contribute 79% to revenue generation
Budget contributes 73% to revenue generation
Popularity contributes 66% revenue generation
